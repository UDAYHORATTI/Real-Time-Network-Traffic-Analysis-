# Real-Time-Network-Traffic-Analysis-
Capture real-time network traffic using scapy or pcapy. Extract features like packet length, protocol, source/destination IPs, and packet inter-arrival times. Train a deep learning model (RNN) to detect anomalies and classify traffic as malicious or benign. Use real-time alerts for detecting intrusion attempts or anomalies in the network.
